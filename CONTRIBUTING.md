* You can use sites like [https://heic.online/](heic.online) to extract the jpeg files from the downloaded .heic files.
* Give your wallpaper a name.
* Arrange the wallpers according to the timings. Start with 12:00 AM (midnight).
* Rename the extracted files in this format: <WALLPAPER_NAME>-<NUMBER>.jpeg
